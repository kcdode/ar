A (slightly jank and not exactly correct) basic AR projector. 

### Execution
All code for running the AR is in `main.py`, with global variables for you to edit at the top, and the entry point to execution towards the bottom (denoted with a comment). Each step documented with a comment to describe what it does, so following the progression of execution should not be terribly difficult. Other than that, the code is structured to be largely self-documenting as to what functions do what and when.
