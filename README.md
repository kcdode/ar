A (slightly jank and mostly accurate)  AR projection app. 

### Execution
All code for running the AR is in `main.py`, with global variables for you to edit at the top, and the entry point to execution towards the bottom (denoted with a comment). Each step in the AR projection documented with a comment to describe what it does.
